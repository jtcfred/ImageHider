keep in mind that it only matters if the hidden image has an alpha channel.
if it does, clear the alpha lsb of the bigger image + clear sig alpha bits on hidden and merge images

currently dont store the channel counts separately in read image!!!!!

calculating the scale factor for the hidden image:
x = big / hidden
